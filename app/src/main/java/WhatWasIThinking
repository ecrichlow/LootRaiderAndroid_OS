This file exists to document the train of thoughts that go into design and implementation decisions.

In-class comments and documentation exist to chronicle how things are.

This file exists to chronicle how things got to be that way. Nothing is ever deleted from this file.
If a decision that was made turns out to have been a poor decision, the thought process that went
into the original decision and the "better" subsequent decision remain in the file.

Days/weeks/months/years from now someone, maybe even you yourself, will need to understand why a
decision was made, or whether or not a design/implementation change should be made.

This file should be your go-to place for understanding the thought process that went into the
evolution of the system. And you should document your own thoughts and decisions here.

Platforms are sprites, not tiles, since they traverse multiple tiles and having them as tiles would force having to change the
attribute of tiles as they were traversed.

Teleporters are sprites, not tiles, which allows for making them movable.

Platforms can use the first sprite for drawing up until it contacts a tile with a solid tile beneath it. Then it can use the
animation frames to bring motion to a stop on the solid tile.

-1 is the dfault value for an unset pixel in a sprite or an unset tile in a gameboard. We default those to the color black
for sprites and the first tile for gameboards.

Transition from one to the next is considered to be once you've hit the halfway point of the tile you're moving into going
left or up, or you've passed the halfway point of your current tile going right or down.

A characteristic is an inherent and immutable property of a sprite as assigned to the sprite in the sprite editor.

An attribute is a property assigned to a tile on a gameboard and is potentially mutable.

Should make for better gameplay if player can pass by a stasis field that has a guard trapped. But guards can't ever pass
through stasis fields, and the player can't pass through an empty stasis field.

All PersistenceManager data is saved and retrieved synchronously, as it shouldn't take any significant amount of time to retrieve.
If we ever start dealing with large data sets it may necessitate adding asynchronous methods.

To manage the features and properties of data storage, all values will be stored as dictionaries. Keys for the dictionaries, and
keys for all dictionary entries, will be strings.

Animations for sendable and receivable teleporters are based on receiving characters to transmit or sending characters back
out of the teleporter, not sending trasmissions between teleporters and receiving transmissons from other teleporters. This
means the animation may be the inverse of what one might expect.

Porting this from iOS, I did almost every graphic only in 1x, except for the logo, which also had a
2x version. 1x iOS translates to mdpi on Android, and xhdpi for the 2x image.
